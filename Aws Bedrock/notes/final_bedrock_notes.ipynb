    "Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed serverless service from AWS that provides API access to various foundation models. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serverless and fully managed\n",
    "- Unified API for multiple foundation models\n",
    "- Pay-per-use pricing model\n",
    "- Access to third-party foundation models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">#architecture</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bedrock service deployed in AWS-managed Bedrock Service Account\n",
    "- Foundation models hosted in AWS-owned Model Provider Escrow Account\n",
    "- Request flow:\n",
    "  1. User initiates request via Console, CLI, or SDK\n",
    "  2. Bedrock service determines appropriate foundation model\n",
    "  3. Request sent to specific model provider account\n",
    "  4. Response returned to user\n",
    "- Networking options:\n",
    "  - API requests over the internet\n",
    "  - Private connectivity via VPC interface endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundation Models\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">#foundationModels</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bedrock provides access to various foundation models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon Titan: General purpose model\n",
    "- AI21 Labs Jurassic-2: Multilingual text generation\n",
    "- Anthropic Claude: Question answering and workflow automation\n",
    "- Stability AI Stable Diffusion: Image generation\n",
    "- Cohere: Text and embedding models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inference Parameters\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">#inferenceParameters</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomness and Diversity\n",
    "- Temperature: Controls output randomness (typically 0-1 or 0-5)\n",
    "- Top K: Limits selection to top K most probable words\n",
    "- Top P: Caps choices based on cumulative probability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Length\n",
    "- Max Length: Controls the length of the generated response (typically 1-4,096 tokens)\n",
    "- Stop Sequence: Stops token generation when specified keyword is encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repetition\n",
    "- Presence Penalty: Reduces probability of repeating tokens\n",
    "- Count Penalty: Lowers probability of word repetition\n",
    "- Frequency Penalty: Reduces probability of repeating tokens, normalized to text length\n",
    "- Penalize Special Token: Reduces repetition of special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pricing\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">#pricing</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-Demand Pricing\n",
    "- Pay-as-you-go model\n",
    "- Charged for input and output tokens (text models)\n",
    "- Per-image pricing for image generation models\n",
    "- Input token pricing for embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provisioned Throughput\n",
    "- For large, consistent workloads or custom models\n",
    "- Requires time commitment (1-6 months)\n",
    "- Significantly more expensive than on-demand pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Console Walkthrough\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">#consoleWalkthrough</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessing Bedrock via AWS console\n",
    "- Requesting model access\n",
    "- Exploring available foundation models\n",
    "- Using the playground for model testing\n",
    "- Creating custom models (fine-tuning)\n",
    "- Managing provisioned throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">#keyTakeaways</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Amazon Bedrock provides serverless access to powerful foundation models\n",
    "2. Inference parameters allow fine-tuning of model outputs\n",
    "3. On-demand pricing is cost-effective for most use cases\n",
    "4. Provisioned throughput offers guaranteed performance for production workloads\n",
    "5. The service is designed for easy integration and experimentation"
